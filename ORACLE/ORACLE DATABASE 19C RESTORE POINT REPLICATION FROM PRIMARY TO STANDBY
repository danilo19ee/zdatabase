+   ORACLE DATABASE 19C RESTORE POINT REPLICATION FROM PRIMARY TO STANDBY   +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
 *The process of flashing back a physical standby to a point in time that was captured on the primary is
  simplified by automatically replicating restore points from primary to the standby.
 *These restore points are called replicated restore points.
 *Irrespective of whether a restore point on the primary database is a guaranteed restore point or a normal restore point, 
  the corresponding replicated restore point is always a normal restore point.

#AUTOMATICALLY REPLICATES RESTORE POINTS FROM A PRIMARY DATABASE TO THE STANDBY DATABASE CONDITIONS
 *Compatible initialization parameter for both the primary database and the standby database is set to 19.0.0 or higher
 *Primary database is open
 *A restore point that is created on a primary database when the primary is in mount mode is not replicated. 
  This restriction is because the restore point information is replicated though the redo.

#NOTE
#ENABLE ARCHIVELOG AFTER ENABLE FLASHBACK
