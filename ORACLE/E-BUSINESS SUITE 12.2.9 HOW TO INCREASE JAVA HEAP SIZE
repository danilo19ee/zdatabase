+  E-BUSINESS SUITE 12.2.9 HOW TO INCREASE JAVA HEAP SIZE +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

THE DEFAULT SIZE OF THE OACORE JVM HEAP IS 512 MB, SUPPORTS 50 TO 100 USERS. 
WHEN AN INSTANCE IS REACHING MORE THAN 200 USERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF JAVA HEAP AT OACORE.
ORACLE RECOMMENDS A 2GB JAVA HEAP, THIS CAN SUPPORT 150 TO 200 USERS. 
FOR GREATER WORK LOAD AND NUMBER OF USERS IT IS POSSIBLE TO ADD MORE OACORES MANAGED SERVERS. ORACLE RECOMMENDS TO HAVE A SERVER FOR TWO CPU´s
THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO MODIFY THE SIZE OF JAVA HEAP. 
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN OPERATION OR WAITING FOR A WINDOW TO PERFORM THE MODIFICATION OF A FILE AND APPLICATION BOUNCE.

[v] Listen Port Enabled                                 Specifies whether this server can be reached through the default plain-text(non-SSL) listen port   
Listen Port:                  7202                      The default TCP port this server uses to listen for regular(non-SSL) incoming connections.
[] SSL Listen Port Enabled                              Indicates whether the server can be reached through the default SSL
SSL Listen Port:              7002                      TCP/IP port at which this server listen for SSL connection requests
