ยบ DESUPPORT OF LEAF NODES IN FLEX CLUSTER ARCHITECTURE
* Leaf nodes are no longer supported in the Oracle Flex Cluster Architecture in Oracle Grid Infrastructure 19c.
* In Oracle Grid Infrastructure 19c (19.1) and later releases, all nodes in an Oracle Flex Cluster function as hub nodes. 
The capabilities offered by Leaf nodes in the original implementation of the Oracle Flex Cluster architecture can as easily be served by hub nodes. 
Therefore, leaf nodes are no longer supported.

DESSUPORT OF ORACLE REAL APPLICATION CLUSTERS FOR STANDARD EDITION 2 (SE2) DATABASE EDITION
* Starting with Oracle Database 19c, Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) is not supported in Oracle Database Standard Edition 2 (SE2).
* Upgrading Oracle Database Standard Edition databases that use Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) functionality from earlier releases to Oracle Database 19c is not possible.
* To upgrade those databases to Oracle Database 19c, either remove the Oracle RAC functionality before starting the upgrade, or upgrade from Oracle Database Standard Edition to Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.
* For more information see My Oracle Support Note 2504078.1: Desupport of Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) with Oracle Database Standard Edition 19c
