#DOWNLOAD WALLET FILE FROM AUTONOMOUS DATABASE

1 - Navigate to the Autonomous Data Warehouse details page.
2 - Click DB Connection.
3 - On the Database Connection page select the Wallet Type:
Instance Wallet: Wallet for a single database only; this provides a database-specific wallet.
Regional Wallet: Wallet for all Autonomous Databases for a given tenant and region (this includes all service instances that a cloud account owns).

4 - Click Download Wallet.
5 - In the Download Wallet dialog, enter a wallet password in the Password field and confirm the password in the Confirm Password field.
The password must be at least 8 characters long and must include at least 1 letter and either 1 numeric character or 1 special character. This password protects the downloaded Client Credentials wallet.
6 - Click Download to save the client security credentials zip file.
By default the filename is: Wallet_databasename.zip. You can save this file as any filename you want.
You must protect this file to prevent unauthorized database access.
