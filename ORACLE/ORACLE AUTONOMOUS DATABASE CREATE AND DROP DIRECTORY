To add a directory, you must have the CREATE ANY DIRECTORY system privilege.

CREATE DIRECTORY staging AS 'stage';

#NOTE
You can also create subdirectories. 

CREATE DIRECTORY sales_staging AS 'stage/sales';

#NOTE
You can create a directory in the root file system to see all the files with the following commands:

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY ROOT_DIR AS '';

#NOTE
After you create the ROOT_DIR directory, use the following command to list all files: 

SELECT * FROM DBMS_CLOUD.list_files('ROOT_DIR');

#NOTE
Use the database DROP DIRECTORY command to drop a directory object.
