+  ORACLE AUTONOMOUS DATABASE CREATE AND DROP DIRECTORY  +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
CREATE DIRECTORY creates the database directory object and also creates the file system directory if it does not already exist
To add a directory, you must have the CREATE ANY DIRECTORY system privilege.

CREATE DIRECTORY staging AS 'stage';

#NOTE
You can also create subdirectories. 

CREATE DIRECTORY sales_staging AS 'stage/sales';

#NOTE
You can create a directory in the root file system to see all the files with the following commands:

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY ROOT_DIR AS '';

#NOTE
After you create the ROOT_DIR directory, use the following command to list all files: 

SELECT * FROM DBMS_CLOUD.list_files('ROOT_DIR');

#NOTE
Use the database DROP DIRECTORY command to drop a directory object. 
The DROP DIRECTORY command does not delete files in the directory. 
If you want to delete the directory and the files in the directory, 
first use the procedure DBMS_CLOUD.DELETE_FILE to delete the files. See DELETE_FILE Procedure for more information.
To drop a directory, you must have the DROP ANY DIRECTORY system privilege.

DROP DIRECTORY staging;

#NOTE
Use the function DBMS_CLOUD.LIST_FILES to list the contents of a directory. 

SELECT * FROM DBMS_CLOUD.LIST_FILES('STAGE');
