+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
AutoUpgrade enables to upgrade one or many Oracle databases at the command-line with a single command and a single configuration file.
AutoUpgrade will run the preupgrade tasks, perform automated fixups where needed, execute the database upgrade, 
and finish by taking care of post-upgrade tasks. It includes automatic retry and fallback, the possibility to schedule upgrades for future points in time, 
and the ability to set, change or remove initialization parameters as desired.
It saves time and money by upgrading hundreds of databases with one command and replacing bespoke high maintenance upgrade solutions.
