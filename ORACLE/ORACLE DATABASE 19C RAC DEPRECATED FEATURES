+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED
The Oracle Database initialization parameter CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES is deprecated in Oracle Database 19c (19.1)
The init.ora parameter CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES specifies the number of configured Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) instances.
Starting with Oracle Database 19c and later releases, the number of configurable Oracle RAC instances is derived automatically from the Oracle Clusterware resource definitions. 
There is no replacement for this parameter, because there is no longer a reason to have this parameter.

#DEPRECATION OF SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION PARAMETER
The SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION sqlnet.ora parameter is deprecated in Oracle Database 19c.
The SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION parameter defines the location of the software keystores for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). 
To configure the software keystore location, instead of setting SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION, Oracle recommends that you set the WALLET_ROOT initialization parameter, and the TDE_CONFIGURATION dynamic initialization parameter.
Oracle recommends that you use the WALLET_ROOT instance initialization parameter as soon as possible, because the value is read once at instance startup time, so all sessions and server background processes share the same path after startup. 
If the SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION parameter is used, then it can lead to confusing misconfigurations, because different sessions can have different SQLNET parameter values. 
Another reason to use WALLET_ROOT is that it is the directory within which you can locate the wallets of other features, such as Oracle Enterprise User Security, and Transport Layer Security. 
This location can become the principal location for all server-side wallets.


#SERVICE_NAMES PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED
Deprecation of the SERVICE_NAMES Initialization Parameter
Starting with Oracle Database 19c, customer use of the SERVICE_NAMES parameter is deprecated. It can be desupported in a future release.
The use of the SERVICE_NAMES parameter is no longer actively supported. It must not be used for high availability (HA) deployments. 
It is not supported to use service names parameter for any HA operations. This restriction includes FAN, load balancing, FAILOVER_TYPE, FAILOVER_RESTORE, SESSION_STATE_CONSISTENCY, and any other uses.
To manage your services, Oracle recommends that you use the SRVCTL or GDSCTL command line utilities, or the DBMS_SERVICE package.
