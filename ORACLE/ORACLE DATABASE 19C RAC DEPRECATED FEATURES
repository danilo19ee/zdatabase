+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED
The Oracle Database initialization parameter CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES is deprecated in Oracle Database 19c (19.1)
The init.ora parameter CLUSTER_DATABASE_INSTANCES specifies the number of configured Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) instances.
Starting with Oracle Database 19c and later releases, the number of configurable Oracle RAC instances is derived automatically from the Oracle Clusterware resource definitions. 
There is no replacement for this parameter, because there is no longer a reason to have this parameter.

#SERVICE_NAMES PARAMETER IS DEPRECATED
Deprecation of the SERVICE_NAMES Initialization Parameter
Starting with Oracle Database 19c, customer use of the SERVICE_NAMES parameter is deprecated. It can be desupported in a future release.
The use of the SERVICE_NAMES parameter is no longer actively supported. It must not be used for high availability (HA) deployments. 
It is not supported to use service names parameter for any HA operations. This restriction includes FAN, load balancing, FAILOVER_TYPE, FAILOVER_RESTORE, SESSION_STATE_CONSISTENCY, and any other uses.
To manage your services, Oracle recommends that you use the SRVCTL or GDSCTL command line utilities, or the DBMS_SERVICE package.
