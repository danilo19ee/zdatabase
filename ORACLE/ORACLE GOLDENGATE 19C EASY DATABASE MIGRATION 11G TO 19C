#TO CREATE THE TWO DATABASE ENVIRONMENTS AND GOLDENGATE HUB, THE FOLLOWING TUTORIALS WERE USED
#ORACLE 11G
https://github.com/danilo19ee/zdatabase/blob/master/ORACLE/ORACLE%20DATABASE%2011G%20SI%20FS%20SILENT%20MODE%20OL7

#ORACLE 19C

#ORACLE GOLDENGATE 19C HUB
https://github.com/danilo19ee/zdatabase/blob/master/ORACLE/ORACLE%20GOLDENGATE%2019C%20HUB%20MACHINE

#TO ACTIVATE ORACLE ARCHIVELOG IN THE DATABASE, THE FOLLOWING TUTORIAL MUST BE USED
#IT IS MANDATORY THAT BOTH DATABASES ARE IN ARCHIVELOG MODE
ORACLE 11G AND ORACLE 19C

#NOTE
With a goldengate hub, it is possible to configure the capture and replication of many databases of different versions. 
Failing to install and configure a goldengate in each environment involved in the data replication process.
The objective of the document is to record the migration of the HR schema from an 11g database 
in the container database to a pluggable database in version 19c, with zero down time

#CONFIRMATION OF REPLICATION TARGET

#NOTE 
Before replicating data with GG, it is necessary to confirm the following points.
* Are unsupported data types / objects used?
* Does it include processing that requires individual settings?
* Is it necessary to convert data with GoldenGate for migration?
* You can see the objects that GG supports in the DBA_GOLDENGATE_SUPPORT_MODE table.

SQL> alter system set enable_goldengate_replication=true;

System altered.

#SETTING THE STREAMS_POOL_SIZE PARAMETER

#NOTE
Set the STREAMS_POOL_SIZE parameter required to start the LogMining Server for the source database. 
As the laboratory is being made in a vm with little resource, it is necessary to increase the space in the sga_target. 
If you followed the oracle database 11g installation guide, your sga_targer will have 1536M, which is insufficient
A reboot is required for the settings to take effect.

SQL> show parameter streams_pool_size

#CREATING A GOLDENGATE ADMINISTRATOR USER

#NOTE
Create a GG admin user in the source database and grant the required privileges. GG related objects are created in this schema.

SQL> create user ggadmin identified by oracle default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp quota unlimited on users;

User created.

SQL> grant dba to ggadmin;

Grant succeeded.

SQL> exec dbms_goldengate_auth.grant_admin_privilege('ggadmin');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

#CHECK ARCHIVE LOG MODE

SQL> archive log list

Automatic archival             Enabled
Archive destination            /u01/app/oracle/oradata/appscdb/archivelog
Oldest online log sequence     3
Next log sequence to archive   5
Current log sequence           5

#SUPPLEMENTAL LOGGING SETTINGS

#NOTE
Configure supplemental logging for the source database so that the GG logs the information it needs in the redo log.
The data required for these operations is automatically recorded in the redo log file. 
GoldenGate gets the change data from the redo log, but the information in the regular redo log is not enough, 
so you need to record additional information in the redo log file. 
The database function for recording additional columns in the redo log is called supplemental logging.
Use the following command to check whether the source database is in supplemental logging mode or forced logging mode.

SQL> select supplemental_log_data_min, force_logging from v$database;

SUPPLEME FOR
-------- ---
NO       NO

SQL> alter database add supplemental log data;

Database altered.

SQL> alter database force logging;

Database altered.

SQL> select supplemental_log_data_min, force_logging from v$database;

SUPPLEME FOR
-------- ---
YES      YES

SQL> alter system switch logfile;

System altered.

#CREATING A DIRECTORY FOR DATA OUTPUT

#NOTE
Create a directory object in the database where you want the expdp utility to extract the data during the initial data migration. 
It then grants the required permissions to users who have permission to access the source schema.
