+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
AD Splicer registers off-cycle product as a valid Oracle Applications product for the given release
The splicing process enables AutoPatch and AD Administration to recognize the off-cycle product
AD Splicer uses control files to manage the splicing process
	â€“ These are not related to the database control files
	
#AD SPLICER CONTROL FILES
Off-cycle products are generally released as patches. All product files and control files necessary to splice in the product are included in the patch.
There is one product configuration file, called newprods.txt. The product configuration file must be edited for your specific system before the off-cycle product can be properly spliced.

#NOTE
The product definition files must not be altered.
There are two product definition files per off-cycle product. They are
	* <prod>prod.txt: which contains language-independent information for product <prod>
	* <prod>terr.txt: which contains language-dependent information for product <prod> <prod> represents the product abbreviation for an Applications product. 
	  For example GL for General Ledger and PO for Purchasing.
The AD Splicer control files must copied from the patch to the APPL_TOP/admin directory.

#EDITING NEWPRODS.TXT

Each spliced product in newprods.txt has an entry such as the following:
	
	product=zsa
	base_product_top=*APPL_TOP*
	oracle_schema=zsa
	sizing_factor=100
	main_tspace=*Product_Name*D
	index_tspace=*Product_Name*X
	temp_tspace=*Temporary Tablespace*
	default_tspace=*Product_Name*D

#POST-SPLICE STEPS	

After the new product is spliced in, the files and objects for this product can be installed. To do this you need to:
	* Log out and log back in so that you are using the new environment file (or registry entries) to set up your environment
	* Verify that <PROD>_TOP environment variables are set for your newly-spliced product
	* Run AutoPatch to install files and database objects for your new product
