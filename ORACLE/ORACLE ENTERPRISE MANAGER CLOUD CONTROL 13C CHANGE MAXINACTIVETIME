The page has expired. Click OK to continue; When you’re not actively using the console, it doesn’t take long before the message appears, 
which is especially annoying when you have the performance monitoring pages running in the background!
According to Oracle it’s a new security feature within the EM12c console.
But it is possible to adjust and avoid this problem.
