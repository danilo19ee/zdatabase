++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
AD Relink is a AD utility that is used to relink oracle Applications AD executables. 
The other executables must be relinked using adadmin. 
In other words AD Relink is used to regenerate an Oracle Applications executable. 
One notable feature of AD relink is that it is not an executable like other Ad utilities. 
It is a shell script that uses the UNIX

Relinking may be required under various scenarios like an executable getting corrupt or lost. 
Relinking is also recommended after cloning, upgrades and patching. 
But mostly Auto Patch will take care of the relinking process at the end of the patching.

	THE FOLLOWING IS THE SYNTAX FOR AD RELINK
	adrelink.sh force={y | n} [optionalargs]
	adrelink force={y|n} [<optional args>] <targets> => to relink programs individually.
	OR
	adrelink force={y|n} [<optional args>] filelist=<file> => to relink many programs.

Here force option is used to specify whether to relink regardless of the status of the library or object files.

#VALID <OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS> ARE:	
	* envfile=adsetenv.sh
	  Used only by the 'adsetup' script
	* link_debug={y|n}
	  Will we link executables with debug or not? Default is 'n'
	* backup_mode={none|all|file}
	  Default is 'file'. Meanings are:
	  - none: do not back up any executables
	  - all : back up all executables
	  - file: do what $APPL_TOP/admin/adlinkbk.txt says to do  

#NOTE
adrelink.sh is situated in $AD_TOP/bin/ directory.	  

#AD RELINK EXAMPLES
To relink adpatch:
'adrelink.sh force=y "ad adpatch"'

To relink adpatch, adsplice, and adadmin:
'adrelink.sh force=y "ad adpatch" "ad adsplice" "ad adadmin"'

To relink all AD executables:
'adrelink.sh force=y "ad all"'

#NOTE
To relink all executables for a non-AD product: Use the AD Administration Utility, not adrelink.

If you we are relinking files on the Concurrent Processing Server then Shut down
the Concurrent Managers before relink operation.

If we are relinking files on the Forms Server then all Oracle applications users must
be logged off before relink operation.
