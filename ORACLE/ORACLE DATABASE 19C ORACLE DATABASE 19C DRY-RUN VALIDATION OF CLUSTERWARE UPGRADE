#NOTE
Oracle Grid Infrastructure installation wizard (gridSetup.sh) enables you to perform a dry-run mode upgrade using dryRunForUpgrade flag to check your system’s upgrade readiness.
In dry-run upgrade mode, the installation wizard performs all of the system readiness checks that it 
would perform in an actual upgrade and enables you to verify whether your system is ready for upgrade before you start the upgrade. 
This mode does not perform an actual upgrade. It helps anticipate potential problems with the system setup and avoid upgrade failures.

§ Steps to perform Dry-Run
#NOTE
Run the Oracle Grid Infrastructure installer in dry-run upgrade mode to determine if the system is ready for upgrade.
At any time during the dry-run upgrade, if you have a question about what you are being asked to do, or what input you 
are required to provide during dry-run upgrade, click the Help button on the installer page.
You should have your network information, storage information, and operating system users and groups available to you before you start dry-run upgrade.

1 - As grid user, download the Oracle Grid Infrastructure image file and extract the file to the Grid home.
For example:
 mkdir -p /u01/app/19.0.0/grid
 chown grid:oinstall /u01/app/19.0.0/grid
 cd /u01/app/19.0.0/grid
 unzip -q download_location/grid_home.zip
 
download_location/grid_home.zip is the path of the downloaded Oracle Grid Infrastructure image file.

2 -Start the Oracle Grid Infrastructure installation wizard in dry-run upgrade mode by running the following command:
 /u01/app/19.0.0/grid/gridSetup.sh -dryRunForUpgrade
3 - Select Upgrade Oracle Grid Infrastructure option to perform dry-run upgrade for Oracle Grid Infrastructure (Oracle Clusterware and Oracle ASM).
4 - On the Node Selection page, select all nodes.
5 - Select installation options as prompted. Oracle recommends that you configure root script automation, so that the rootupgrade.sh script can be run automatically during the dry-run upgrade.
6 - Run root scripts, either automatically or manually:
 Running root scripts automatically:
  If you have configured root script automation, then the installer will run the rootupgrade.sh script automatically on the local node.
 Running root scripts manually
  If you have not configured root script automation, then when prompted, run the rootupgrade.sh script on the local node.
  If you run root scripts manually, then run the script only on the local node.
7 - Check the gridSetupActions<timestamp>.log log file for errors and fix errors reported in the log file.
8 - Exit the installer on the Finish screen and relaunch it without any flag to start an actual upgrade.
