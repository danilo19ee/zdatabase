#NOTE
Supplemental logging was designed and implemented for Logical Standby or full database replication requirements. 
This adds unnecessary overhead in environments where only a subset of tables is being replicated. 
Fine-grained supplemental logging provides a way for partial database replication users to disable supplemental 
logging for uninteresting tables so that even when supplemental logging is enabled in database or schema level, 
there is no supplemental logging overhead for uninteresting tables.
Use of this feature can significantly reduce the overhead in terms of resource usage and redo generation in case when only some of the tables 
in the database require supplemental logging, such as in a Golden Gate partial replication configuration.
If both source and mining database are at redo compatibility 19 or higher and the value of enable_goldengate_replication is TRUE, 
then Oracle Database 19c and higher provides an advantage of reduced supplemental logging overhead for Oracle GoldenGate.

ยง HOW TO ENABLE
 
 SQL> ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION;
 ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION
 *
 ERROR at line 1:
 ORA-26947: Oracle GoldenGate replication is not enabled.

 SQL> alter system set enable_goldengate_replication=true;
 System altered.

 SQL> ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION;
 Database altered.

 SQL> SELECT supplemental_log_data_min, supplemental_log_data_sr from v$database; 

 SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_MIN      SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_SR
 ------------------------------ ------------------------------
 IMPLICIT                       YES

ยง HOW TO DISABLE
 
 SQL> ALTER DATABASE DROP SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION;
 ALTER DATABASE DROP SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION
 *
 ERROR at line 1:
 ORA-31545: cannot drop subset database replication when there is no other
 database (container) level supplemental log setting


 Note:
 If no other database-level supplemental log is explicitly enabled, this DDL would fail.  
 This is to prevent the loss of supplemental log data during replication. 
 In this case, you need to add minimal supplemental logging explicitly using the command 
 ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA; 
 and then execute 
 ALTER DATABASE DROP SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION;


 SQL> ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA; 
 Database altered. 

 SQL> ALTER DATABASE DROP SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA SUBSET DATABASE REPLICATION; 
 Database altered. 

 SQL> SELECT supplemental_log_data_min, supplemental_log_data_sr from v$database;

 SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_MIN      SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_SR
 ------------------------------ ------------------------------
 YES                            NO
