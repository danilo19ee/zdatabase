#PRODUCT INTRODUCTION
Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that allows you to easily
run applications on a hosted cloud server instance cluster. With this service, you don't need to install, operate, 
and extend your cluster management infrastructure. You can start and stop Docker applications, query the complete status of the cluster, 
and use various cloud services with simple API calls. You can arrange the placement of containers in a cluster based on 
resource requirements and availability requirements to meet the specific requirements of your business or application.

Based on native Kubernetes, Tencent Cloud Container Service provides a container-centric solution to solve the environmental problems 
of user development, testing, and operation and maintenance, helping users reduce costs and improve efficiency. Tencent Cloud Container
Service is fully compatible with the native Kubernetes API, and has expanded Kubernetes plug-ins such as Tencent Cloud â€™s cloud disks 
and load balancing. At the same time, based on the Tencent Cloud private network, a highly reliable and high-performance network solution 
is implemented.
