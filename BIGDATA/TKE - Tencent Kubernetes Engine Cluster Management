*Container network: 	   	IP addresses in the container network address range will be assigned to the cluster inner container. 
						      You can customize the three private network segments as the container network. 
						      Based on the upper limit of the number of services in the cluster you choose, 
						      the CIDR segment of the appropriate size is automatically allocated Used for kubernetes service; 
						      according to the maximum number of pods / nodes you select, an appropriate size network segment is 
						      automatically assigned to each cloud server in the cluster for the host to assign a Pod IP address.
						
*CIDR:                  	Network segment where resources such as services and pods in the cluster are located.
