Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.


Warning: Version constraints inside provider configuration blocks are deprecated

  on provider.tf line 2, in provider "oci":
   2:   version          = ">= 4.3.0" 

Terraform 0.13 and earlier allowed provider version constraints inside the
provider configuration block, but that is now deprecated and will be removed
in a future version of Terraform. To silence this warning, move the provider
version constraint into the required_providers block.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

provider configuration block, but that is now deprecated and will be removed
in a future version of Terraform. To silence this warning, move the provider
version constraint into the required_providers block.

Warning: Version constraints inside provider configuration blocks are deprecated

Warning: Version constraints inside provider configuration blocks are deprecated

  on provider.tf line 2, in provider "oci":
   2:   version          = ">= 4.19.0" 

Terraform 0.13 and earlier allowed provider version constraints inside the
provider configuration block, but that is now deprecated and will be removed
in a future version of Terraform. To silence this warning, move the provider
version constraint into the required_providers block.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
