What is blockchain?
A blockchain is a tamper-evident, shared digital ledger that records transactions in a public or private peer-to-peer network. 
The blockchain acts as a single source of truth, and members in a blockchain network can view only those transactions that are relevant to them.

What a distributed ledger is A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a decentralized network. 
The distributed ledger records the transactions, such as the exchange of assets or data, among the participants in the network.
Participants in the network govern and agree by consensus on the updates to the records in the ledger. 
No central authority or third-party mediator, such as a financial institution or clearinghouse, is involved. 
Every record in the distributed ledger has a timestamp and unique cryptographic signature, thus making the ledger an auditable, 
immutable history of all transactions in the network.
